I always tip the highest preset amount when I get a ride and would be happy to pay more in advance if I could just get a ride. So I'm usually forced to go by Bolt these days as they never turn me down.",2.0,10-08-2023 14:51,4.485.10000

Unfortunately their customer service is awful, drivers are canceling left and right and they will not make it right for customers. Update 2023 Nothing has changed service is still the same drivers are always late they always give you a driver that's 20 to 15 minutes away it's ridiculous and then if you want to schedule an Uber you have to pay $57 to schedule in advance.

The waiting time shown in the app is fake, for eg it shows 1 min but your cab/rikshaw/moto comes after 5-8 mins. Pls fix this, it's very irritating and made me miss my exam twice... 2. A lot of time it happens that it shows that the driver has arrived but is no where to be seen near the pickup spot and when I cancel it I have to give Rs17 extra...

665ccc6e-a64d-46f2-a436-33d160027968,Spike Zilla,Imagine you have to get somewhere at a certain time. You have where you want to go and where you currently are set up. Your driver arrives somewhere else that isn't exactly where you are despite your location on the map. You are being timed to meet them and you're using the map to find them. However the map won't accurately point you in the right direction so you'll be running around aimlessly until you can finally go the right direction by trail and error. That's what Uber is like. A waste.,1.0,09-08-2023 17:48,

Before the teacher arrived at her place of employment she politely asked if both myself and the driver would be so kind join her in a short prayer. In agreement, she prayed. Amen. Thank God. I'm blessed & inspired. B-day Gift of Uber & Angelüëç",5.0,07-08-2023 16:11,4.479.10001

But suddenly they charged me with extra 33$ today with no explanation whatsoever. And the previous bill cannot be found anywhere and they haven't explained what happened to the discount.

Uber drivers have scammed me 2 times by sending me the wrong driver and the wrong car and they misbehaved me and charged me for no reason even without picking me to my direcrion. I think this app should be banned that is scamming and doing fraud with its customers and looting them. I request to the team to ban their services if they are not willing to improve.

0ccae1ea-6acd-4338-bf66-23905b753d76,yogesh sawant,In my past trip that is somewhere 90 days before I was not able to made payment through digitally due to technical error. So I paid that amount through cash I have with. Now after that I have not used Uber as I am in my home town. Now I came back to pune. Used uber for booking. After trip got completed the amount of previous trip got added into it as it is saying unpaid. Even though I paid this through cash. When contacted customer care they are saying we can do for the trip older than 90 days.,1.0,06-08-2023 03:51,

You wait for drivers for more than 15 minutes and each if them cancel one by one. Which doesn't make sense because I have a high rating. I don't see anyway this app can be developed. Money is taken from your bank account before you get the ride and have multiple drivers cancel, causing it to have a long process for you to get you money back.",1.0,06-08-2023 02:58,

Uber in Cape Town needs a serious perspective change as its very unreliable there. Too many cancelled trips by drivers, drivers not wanting short trips, wait times in excess of 15min, number of drivers decrease significantly as it gets later leading to you being stranded late at night.

It often happens that the drivers cancel after 5-10 mins of accepting the ride or will keep moving in some other direction instead of coming to the location. In that case the user will try to book by some other app or will manage in some other way and might forget that the ride search is ongoing.",4.0,05-08-2023 04:32,4.485.10000

If you don't want to let us use our credit card for payment then why are letting us add our card on the mode? Just to get details of our CC ?

When I requested a vehicle, it took ten minutes to find out there were no drivers for that kind of vehicle and it recommended I try again with a different type (X to Comfort), same thing again. 20 minutes wasted looking for a ride to find out there were no drivers. It wouldn't have bothered me if it just said no drivers right away. Instead, I waited for no reason. If you need to get places, don't trust Uber to be there.",1.0,04-08-2023 15:02,4.484.10000

They don't even read your question in the in-app support. Do you have a problem to discuss? Too bad, they don't offer phone support. After that review, they will come and comment here as they care and they want to figure this out. Uber support is the reason that I didn't use Uber for more than 5 months but Lyft instead.

People are dropping dead in the heat and they are trying to make extra money off of them. I literally have screenshots of messages accusing them of such and then magically the price is halved. (After 2nd attempt) Evil company. (Contact me for the proof) Then I got blacklisted can't get food delivered all night long. Thier bottom line is more important than a life.,1.0,04-08-2023 03:48,

The friend who booked me the Uber was a visiting tourist and was out of the country in 24h so no way to register a complaint or advise Uber via app. As a passenger there is no outside complaint method to speak to a live person unless you go through the app if you booked it yourself.

I want this charge to be on this card, not the one I was forced to put it on! I have had good experiences with all the Uber drivers.

Every conversation I have ever had with anyone about Uber is consistent in that they aren't transparent, don't listen to their contractors, or at least make it expectionally difficult for them to have a voice. They overcharge a customer and give less than they should to their contractors.",3.0,02-08-2023 10:51,4.484.10000

That i have to go to the website to get resolution. There is no chat optoin just frequently asked questions. Was told by a rep that he can't handle customer service related inquiries but it should be resolved by booking another uber all it did was charge me more.

6e47fd19-dd3b-423e-a7f9-cc2808d0d54a,Patrick Metzger,I recently reserved an Uber Premier ride at my local airport. What Uber described was a much faster pickup since the driver would be standing by waiting on me to arrive. The actual pickup time was the same as a regular Uber reservation made on the spot. I still had to wait in the crowded ride share pickup area. The pickup stall was randomly assigned like any other ride. I basically paid a significant premium to ride in a large SUV. Uber has no way to report this issue as feedback via the app.,1.0,01-08-2023 16:31,4.484.10000

Used DiDi at the same time it booked at $35 so I thought I'd wait till morning and try my luck. To my surprise the Uber fee went down to $45 but also so did DiDis down to $27.

Another thing that I cannot stand is the fact that they will accept your ride and then they will cancel on you .

This is so frustrating because even if weather is good I want the AC because I don't want to inhale pollution and dust - but the drivers always want to avoid turning on the AC.,4.0,30-07-2023 01:32,4.484.10000

However, after the ride, he took my phone and claimed he could apply a promo code for 5 free rides. As expected, he lied and booked a second ride without my consent. I immediately complained to Uber support, but they have yet to respond. This incident makes me question their driver verification process.

ee1d9000-48dc-4725-88db-12f56ba81558,SOMU K B,If i book a ride the ride drivers are calling and asking wt is the amount showing and they start beg for 50 or 100rs more and if we didn't meet there final amount which is 200rs more than the actual amount the ride drivers will tell us to cancel the ride and the will also be same. I shouldn't give even 1 star coz this is the worst app i ever seen. Thank you,1.0,28-07-2023 21:23,4.484.10000

There is no where on the ap to tell you this. Needless to say I nearly missed my flight. Very annoying. Won't be using pre book feature again. I think there should be somewhere on app to tell you no driver is willing to take you on your journey so at least you can make alternative arrangements especially when it evolves plane travel.

There is no phone number and no email address to contact them. Currently Booking Fees are now added to the charges. These do not support the drivers and are essentially an additional charge with a vague description. Most drivers have been really nice and professional. This review is of Uber rather than a specific ride. The level of cost from the corporate side is huge.,3.0,24-07-2023 00:37,4.483.10000

a966f9ee-bcc5-4901-8be2-1498deb923e3,Katrina Addison,They pay the drivers garbage. We only make 50% of the fare's. Customers rarely tip. Gas prices are so high that we can hardly make ends meet. Most of us aren't able to see where we are going or how much we are making before accepting and completing the trips which is unsafe and unfair for our time and gas. Customer service is a joke and won't resolve anything. Ever. As independent contractors we should have full access to information about the trips value and destination before accepting.,1.0,23-07-2023 21:55,

I do however wish they had handicap wheelchair accessible vans available so that I could also use uber. Our city only has 3 vans running during the day and 1 after 8pm. It can make it very difficult for someone in a wheelchair. If Uber ever gets accessible vans I will be using them often.,4.0,22-07-2023 23:55,4.483.10000

The drivers who have accepted to give you a ride, but they just suddenly cancel and there is no accountability at all. You cannot rate those who cancel out on you.

We try booking way in advance knowing that these cancellations have been happening and still we end up being late.

I was charged $91 by Uber which I assumed was a fraudulent charge, but apparently they changed my account to annual without telling me or even updating my account?

c08f284f-9db1-49c1-a865-09ccb4808d7f,Andrea Lin,Uber delivery interface is not well designed. Other apps and browser interfaces will show you the total charges with applied promotions so you can tell if you applied it correctly or not. I had to trouble the Uber support staff to retroactively apply a promo code because it wasn't obvious that it wasn't applied until AFTER I got a final receipt of charges. 5 stars for Uber support staff.,3.0,22-07-2023 01:06,4.483.10000

ff2e087d-5ce1-45fe-adee-14a528e6c5db,J H,I use Lyft often and Uber seldom and today Uber disappointed again. I ordered a ride which was canceled by the driver and I then found other means. In the mean time after I left another driver messages me that he is at pick up point. I told him I didn't ordered his car and no longer needed a ride. But apparently he initiated the ride to show me onboard and then called me a few minutes later and said I needed to cancel the trip. This way he is guaranteed some income versus none.

I had no idea what that was. Figured it was a prepayment option. Not surprisingly my balance was $0 and the app did not let me switch to my preferred method I had used in the past. I was forced to add money to Uber cash to pay for the ride. More aggravation when I found the amount you can add was fixed - $25/$50/$100.,3.0,21-07-2023 18:29,4.483.10000

You have just provided the questions what ever you want. So just call back n help me with the the inconvenience caused due to your app and the harrasment done by you so call driver joseph duri ...

There's no quality control whatsoever as any uber driver can accept the ride, call you to understand the location and cancel the ride at their own will if they don't feel like accepting it. That's first of all a ride thing to do and second of all, it is mere a wastage of time for the customer. You guys seriously need to put a ban on these idiotic drivers to not be able to cancel a ride if they have accepted it.",1.0,21-07-2023 04:26,

6ac7719a-2ba3-4a9f-9522-0902d1d8deca,Villeta Pinson,Uber's been very disappointing since I paid my $70. Was better getting the 5% off. Prices are RIDICULOUS I have been taking LYFT more than Uber!! üí•üí•One thing that I would like to see on the app it's the ability to enter all the destinations you want to go to whether it is one place to another or multiple stops. That way I could get the total price and the Uber driver that gets the call has the total package instead of someone adding stuff after they have accepted the customer then they cancel.,2.0,19-07-2023 19:21,4.483.10000

I know, I know, there's multiple ways for me to opt out of them. here's a crazy idea: let me OPT IN instead, and I won't feel that your app is worth just 1 star.

They have no call support whatsoever even you get into an accident or your driver misbehaves with you.

Now if you try to cancel the ride then the Uber app will charge you a cancellation fee. How wonderful üòä This breed of drivers will use other apps, keep getting rides there.

When we book an uber they ask us where we want to go before they even come and then act rudely and don't come if we don't tell them. They don't even cancel the trip or forward it they just let us sit there waiting with no rides. There's nothing stopping these drivers from behaving badly.

Most expensive and still bad cars, no drivers, long wait queues, no more black service. Its price is going up while service is going down. This is not a price complaint, I dont mind high prices if I am getting the good service which is I am not getting at all.

The app tells you it can't match a driver at the moment but a driver will call you 5 mins after you got alternate transportation asking where you are. When you get matched with a driver and it says 3 mins but when you check 3 mins later it says 7 mins with a whole different car.

Knowing if there is a driver shortage or wait time would be helpful. The tip doesn't always update on the app. I left a tip and it said I rated the driver but didn't leave a tip. I redid the tip and the app then doubled my tip. My driver was okay but not worth of a 36% tip.

The app has bugs every now and again where your accurate location isn't picked up precisely like off a block or so, that might be the drivers mistakes sometimes not quite sure. I'll have the time for my pick up changed a few times manking my wait longer or the driver might cancel for whatever reason while on route but I've rarely had those bad experiences.",4.0,17-07-2023 16:42,4.482.10000

Many times the app does not work and it does not show drop location at drivers' end and when you cancel, they demand cancellation charges. 2. The driver doesn't move in the map and does not pick up calls, you just wait for no reason and when you cancel they want cancellation charges. 3. Many times the otp itself is not shown in app and you'll not be able to get it, then you'll need to cancel bear charge",1.0,17-07-2023 14:25,4.482.10000

87ba2ca5-90c8-4e85-bfbf-f5900efd1f74,nitin parihar,Recently facing lot of issues with the way uber operates in Hyderabad. It keeps searching for driver like 5-10 mins. Then if you get booking driver calls and cancels. Even if he arrives he asks for cash and requests to cancel. Cancelation charge gets deducted and at times you end up paying twice. Online payment auto deduct is not accepted by the drivers . Please make some strict policies for driver else you will lose customers. Whole point to use uber was to stop driver monopoly.

31bbefec-0023-4e6c-816e-dcb4586d1fff,Sandeep Bhatt,The app is great and all with drivers present at all time. But few things that I would like to mention. 1. A lot of driver asks for us about the payment method and cancel the ride if the payment is not in cash. So Uber should create an option for drivers to choose preferred payment option. That way we won't waste time booking ride that the driver will refuse later. 2. The cleanliness of cars in Delhi has degraded. Only 1-2 out of 10 cars is clean. 3. Driver accept the ride and later cancel it.,1.0,15-07-2023 08:50,4.482.10000

But I can contact their support and explain my issue through writing single message and providing screenshots that is not the case with uber.

I tried calling the places directly and they said uber had to do it because they didn't make the reservation. Uber does not have a call number and their chat function still hasn't replied after almost 3hrs and multiple attempts to reach out in the same space. There is no way to adjust it yourself like they claim after the reservation is confirmed. Highly disappointed and can not cancel as the cancellation is almost more than what I'd pay.,1.0,12-07-2023 22:42,4.481.10002

fbaea3f4-a684-489d-9aed-75bd6b46275f,Shaun Hayes,This is an app review not at all any driver review. But it is not fair that you book a journey which was 9.30 and by mistake I hit cancel so re ordered the exact same journey and it went up to 13.90?? How can the same journey be 4 pound more when booked max 60seconds later. Your operator and manager Angela gave the excuses of oh well different times of day cause this.....it was 1min max apart when booked. This happens more often than not tbh with Uber qnd I would write more but only 500 chr able,2.0,12-07-2023 14:43,4.481.10002

9359a086-9020-4dad-9fc5-befbbc2c4e61,Dustin Lovell,Price surges are rediculous and make no sense. It will kump 20 dollars for absolutly no reason for a 3 block ride and say its because its busy but there will be 10 cars on the scrwen but thennext day at the samw time there will be one car and 20 dollars cheaper. And i know the drivers dont get anywhere near what the up chargea are. Turning into a scam.,2.0,12-07-2023 02:25,4.481.10002

At 5:24 I learn that it was canceled at 4:51 because Uber was attempting to charge me for the cancelation. At 5:26 I attempted to request again and it assigns the same driver who cancels.

I had called uber coustomer by the choosing help option given by uber initially it's response but my journey has finished then it did not pick up call and not also giving coustomer care. I have taken the medicine by the doctor and my phone is already damaged but uber has not given any charges.Uber app is totally irresponsible and not take care of coust,1.0,11-07-2023 12:04,4.481.10002
